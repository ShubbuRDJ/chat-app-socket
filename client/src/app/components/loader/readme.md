# Loader Component
The Loader component is a React component designed to display a loading spinner while waiting for content or data to load. This component utilizes the react-loader-spinner library to create a visually appealing loading animation.

## Installation
To use the Loader component, you'll need to have React and react-loader-spinner installed in your project. You can install react-loader-spinner using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install react-loader-spinner
```
## Usage
Here's how you can use the Loader component in your React application:

1. Import the Loader component:
```bash
import Loader from './Loader'; // Update the path as per your project structure
```
2. Use the Loader component in your JSX wherever you want to display a loading animation:
```bash
<Loader />
```

## Props
The Loader component does not require any specific props. It's a simple loading spinner component with default styles.

## Example
Here's a complete example of using the Loader component:
```bash
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Loader from './Loader';

function YourComponent() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  // Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., data fetching)
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setLoading(false); // Set loading to false when data is ready
    }, 2000); // Simulated 2-second delay
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? (
        <Loader /> // Display the loader while data is loading
      ) : (
        // Your content to display when loading is complete
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome to Your App</h1>
          {/* Rest of your component */}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default YourComponent;
```

In this example, the Loader component is used to display a loading spinner while data is being fetched asynchronously. Once the data is ready, the loading spinner is replaced with the actual content.
